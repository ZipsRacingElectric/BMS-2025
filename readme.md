# Battery Management System - Zips Racing 2025
Embedded firmware for the battery management system of ZR25. The BMS is responsible for monitoring:

- All series cell voltages
- All sense line statuses (open circuit)
- The temperature of at least 20% of all cells

To do this, the BMS uses the LTC68XX series of battery management ICs. These ICs act like an isolated I/O expander for the microcontroller, allowing all of the above measurements to be performed.
